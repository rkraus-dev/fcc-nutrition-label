# 🌐 FCC Nutritional Label - ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen)

This project is a detailed replica of a Nutrition Facts label, created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum. The primary focus was on mastering CSS Typography and the Box Model to achieve a professional, standardized print-like layout purely with HTML and CSS.

## 🛠 Technologies
* **HTML5:** Basic semantic structure for labeling food data.
* **CSS3:** Advanced typography, custom borders, and layout positioning.
* **Google Fonts:** Integration of the 'Open Sans' typeface for authentic styling.
* **Flexbox:** Used for aligning nutrient values and percentages across the label.

## 🚀 Features
* **Precise Typography:** Implementation of various font weights (400, 700, 800) and sizes using `rem` and `em`.
* **Custom Dividers:** Creation of different line thicknesses (small, medium, large) using empty divs and background colors.
* **Responsive Alignment:** Use of `justify-content: space-between` to align nutrient names and values perfectly.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Effective use of bold text and indentation (single and double) to represent sub-nutrients.

## 🧠 The Process
1.  **Structuring the Content:** Defined the semantic HTML layout, separating the header, calorie information, and daily value sections.
2.  **Typography Setup:** Imported 'Open Sans' and set up global font rules to ensure consistency.
3.  **Refining the Box Model:** Adjusted padding, margins, and `box-sizing: border-box` to keep the label's width fixed at 270px.
4.  **Implementing Dividers:** Developed a reusable `.divider` class system to manage the horizontal lines that define the label's sections.
5.  **Fine-Tuning Layout:** Used negative margins and specific flexbox alignments to match the official FDA-style nutrition label spacing.
